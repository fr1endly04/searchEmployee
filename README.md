# Axios Prerequisite for Tests

Why Axios?
Axios is a popular promise-based HTTP client for making requests to APIs. It is lightweight, easy to use, and works seamlessly in both Node.js and browser environments. The tests in this repository depend on axios for HTTP requests.

By ensuring axios is installed before running the tests, you avoid potential errors and ensure proper functionality.

## Installation
